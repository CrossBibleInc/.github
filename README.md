üìñ An interactive web-based application that enhances the digital Bible study experience.

## ‚úùÔ∏è Our Mission

Our web-based Bible software is intended to bolster worldwide engagement with Scripture in new and innovate ways. Cross Bible will offer carefully curated Bible resources in a user-friendly application for a diverse audience of students on a variety of levels. Our Biblical language resources will promote the study of **Greek** and **Hebrew** as a tool that breaks down the language barrier unlocking deeper meaning in the Bible. Our multilingual tools will empower users to explore the rich history of the Bible in multiple translations, including translations of the **Greek Old Testament**.

## üñ•Ô∏è For Developers

At Cross Bible, we're on a mission to revolutionize Bible study through technology. By integrating advanced web technologies like AWS, ECS, Nuxt, Vue, Laravel, TypeScript, and MySQL, we aim to create an accessible, engaging platform. We invite developers passionate about using their skills for a greater purpose to join us. Your contributions will support a non-denominational project focused on making scripture study more interactive and meaningful.

We uphold strict data privacy standards and legal compliance to ensure our platform remains secure and reliable. Join us in this journey of learning, discovery, and technological innovation to make the Bible freely accessible to all.

## üöÄ Favorite Technologies

We're interested in teaming up with developers who are proficient in any aspect of our tech stack. We work with people who share our goal of developing a wonderful user experience, leveraging technology to enhance Bible study. 

Our platform thrives on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. We love the **Vue.js** and  **Nuxt** ecosystems for their seemless developer experience in both **Javascript** and **TypeScript**. Our **Laravel** framework gives us the reliability of **PHP** for interacting with the Biblical text in our **MySQL** database. And since the Cross Bible prototype was built in **Filemaker Pro**, we love the **Claris** platform for data management, along with **Python** for additional text parsing in multiple languages.

Join us in shaping the future of Bible study!
