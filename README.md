üìñ An interactive web-based application that enhances the digital Bible study experience.

## ‚úùÔ∏è Our Mission

Our web-based Bible software is intended to bolster worldwide engagement with Scripture in new and innovate ways. Cross Bible will offer carefully curated Bible resources in a user-friendly application for a diverse audience of students on a variety of levels. Our Biblical language resources will promote the study of **Greek** and **Hebrew** as a tool that breaks down the language barrier unlocking deeper meaning in the Bible. Our multilingual tools will empower users to explore the rich history of the Bible in multiple translations, including translations of the **Greek Old Testament**.

## üñ•Ô∏è For Developers

We're interested in teaming up with developers who are proficient in any aspect of our tech stack. We work with people who share our goal of developing a wonderful user experience, leveraging technology to enhance Bible study. We are a non-denominational Christian organization that does not require any religious test or oath from collaborators who are dedicated to helping us improve the Bible study experience. We're open to working with people from a variety of backgrounds, nationalities, ethnicities, languages, genders, and religious traditions.

We're actively raising funds grow our team. So, even if we don't have a position for you yet, we love making contacts in the developer community. 

If you're interested in applying to work with us, [reach out to us](mailto:info@crossbible.com).

## üöÄ Favorite Technologies 

Our platform thrives on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. We love the **Laravel** ecosystems for their seemless developer experience in **PHP** and **Alpine.js** with **LiveWire**. We leverage Laravel Vapor for severless deployment on **AWS Lambda** and **Cloudfront (CDN)**. The **Laravel** framework gives us the reliability of **PHP** for interacting with the Biblical text in our **PostgreSQL** database. And since the Cross Bible prototype was built in **Filemaker Pro**, we love the **Claris** platform for data management, along with **Python** for additional text parsing in multiple languages.

Join us in shaping the future of Bible study!
